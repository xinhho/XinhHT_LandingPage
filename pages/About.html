                Here, we'll provide you with some examples of the final look of the blog website you will build as part of your project. 
                Note that these use placeholder text, which you will also be allowed to utilize in the project instead of 
                needing to type out all of your own blog posts (although you are certainly encouraged to do so!).
                Note that while these examples include most, if not all, of the requirements under the project rubric, 
                the exact layout and styling is completely up to you. The bottom of the rubric contains some extra ways to stand out, 
                 but customizing the layout & styling of your blog website is a great way to create a unique website of your own regardless.
